# inventory
Very quick and very dirty inventory tracking

inventory.py was created as a way to quickly and easily keep track of salable inventory for NOVA Pride (www.novapride.org).

Items were added by hand using the menu options provided. Items were added to the DB using a USB Barcode Scanner or typed by hand.

The DB was then exported to .csv for management and stock verification.

Future plans include to structure the DB to match the square format for ease of import/export
